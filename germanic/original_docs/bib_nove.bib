abstract = {The relationship between group and individual has been explored within the variationist paradigm. In L1, group patterns of variation are replicated by the individual. Second language acquisition research is concerned with the individual learner, but second language acquisition variationist researchers tend to group learners. Little empirical evidence exists that such grouping is valid, given the importance of individual variation. This article investigates whether it is meaningful to group learners. This is a longitudinal, quantitative study of the acquisition of variation by Irish speakers of French L2 over three years, of which one is a year abroad experience. Participants are five advanced learners, twenty years old, with five years of French classes at secondary school and two at university. A computer (Varbrul) analysis shows similar patterns in group and individual, in the deletion of ne. Theoretical implications are that it is legitimate to apply group standards to individual speakers and that native speaker variation acquisition is linked to a prolonged stay in the native speaker community. {\textcopyright} 2004, Walter de Gruyter.

abstract = {The Atlas of North American English provides the first overall view of the pronunciation and vowel systems of the dialects of the U.S. and Canada. The Atlas re-defines the regional dialects of American English on the basis of sound changes active in the 1990s and draws new boundaries reflecting those changes. It is based on a telephone survey of 762 local speakers, representing all the urbanized areas of North America. It has been developed by Bill Labov, one of the leading sociolinguists of the world, together with his colleagues Sharon Ash and Charles Boberg. The Atlas consists of a printed volume accompanied by an interactive CD-ROM. The print and multimedia content is alsoavailable online. Combined Edition: Book and Multimedia CD-ROM The printed volume contains 23 chapters that re-define the geographic boundaries of North American dialects and trace the influence of gender, age, education, and city size on the progress of sound change; findings that show a dramatic and increasing divergence of English in North America; 139 four color maps that illustrate the regional distribution of phonological and phonetic variables across the North American continent; 120 four color vowel charts of individual speakers. The interactive multimedia CD-ROM supplements the printed articles and maps by providing a data base with measurements of more than 100,000 vowels and mean values for 439 speakers; the Plotnik program for mapping each of the individual vowel systems; extended sound samples of all North American dialects; interactive applications to enhance classroom presentations. Online only Version: Print and Multimedia Content The online only version offers simultaneous access to the print and multimedia content to all users in the university/library network; presents a wider selection of interactive data, maps, and audio samples that will be recurrently updated; provides students with concurrent access to research material for classroom assignments.

abstract = {This article discusses sociolinguistically oriented research on second language acquisition (SLA) in the decade since Firth and Wagner (1997). Over the last 10 years, substantial progress has been made in developing a model of the sociolinguistic processes that inform second language acquisition. This model is supported by empirical evidence on the relationship between social context and second language use and acquisition, which shows that learners' second language (L2) input and processing of L2 input in social settings are socially mediated, that social and linguistic context affect linguistic use, choice, and development, and that learners intentionally assert social identities through their L2 in communicating in social contexts. A strength of sociolinguistically oriented SLA research is its strong focus on linguistic outcomes, tracking the impact of contextual factors in producing those outcomes. Preston (2000, 2002) and Fasold and Preston (2006) provided a central sociolinguistic framework to integrate research on the interaction of social factors and cognitive processes in producing interlanguage, which is a variable linguistic system. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Modern Language Journal.},

B. (2012). Rapid and multifaceted effects of second-language learning on first-language speech production. This "phonetic drift" of L1 production in novice L2 learners was consistent with reports of phonetic drift in advanced L2 learners; however, the fact that novice learners showed relatively pronounced drift was unexpected. To explore the hypothesis that this pattern is due to a novelty effect boosting the encoding and retrieval of elementary L2 experience, the current study compared the inexperienced learners analyzed previously (learners with no prior knowledge of the L2) to experienced learners enrolled in the same language program. In accordance with the hypothesis, experienced learners manifested less phonetic drift in their production of L1 stops and vowels than inexperienced learners, suggesting that progressive familiarization with an L2 leads to reduced phonetic drift at later stages of L2 experience. These findings contradict the assumption that L2 influence on the L1 is weakest at early stages of L2 learning and argue in favor of viewing the L1 and L2 both as dynamic systems undergoing continuous change.},

abstract = {In New Zealand English there is a merger-in-progress of the near and square diphthongs. This paper investigates the consequences of this merger for speech perception. We report on an experiment involving the speech of four New Zealanders-two male, and two female. All four speakers make a distinction between near and square. Participants took part in a binary forced-choice identification task which included 20 near/square items produced by each of the four speakers. All participants were presented with identical auditory stimuli. However the visual presentation differed. Across four conditions, we paired each voice with a series of photos-an "older" looking photo, a "younger" looking photo, a "middle class" photo and a "working class" photo. The middle and working class photos were, in fact, photos of the same people, in different attire. In a fifth condition, participants completed the task with no associated photos. At the end of the identification task, each participant was recorded reading a near/square wordlist, containing the same items as appeared in the perception task. The results show that a wide range of factors influence accuracy in the perception task. These include participant-specific characteristics, word-specific characteristics, context-specific characteristics, and perceived speaker characteristics. We argue that, taken together, the results provide strong support for exemplar-based models of speech perception, in which exemplars are socially indexed. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examined these effects in novice learners, adult native English speakers enrolled in elementary Korean classes. In two acoustic studies, learners' production of English was found to be influenced by even brief experience with Korean. The effect was consistently one of assimilation to phonetic properties of Korean; moreover, it occurred at segmental, subsegmental, and global levels, often simultaneously. Taken together, the results suggest that cross-language linkages are established from the onset of second-language learning at multiple levels of phonological structure, allowing for pervasive influence of second-language experience on first-language representations.

It is the story of the loyalty of its members to their rebbes and their teachings and to the milieu they created in an old Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. Based on his previous book Williamsburg: A Jewish Community in Transition, which reported the transformation of this moderately Orthodox Jewish community and its rise to prominence after the influx of numbers of refugees from Nazi persecution and the Holocaust, George Kranzler presents the findings of a decade of research into the survival and life-style of Hasidic Williamsburg as a functioning community. Hasidic Williamsburg portrays the desperate struggle and relentless efforts of its leaders, foremost among them the Rebbe of Satmar and other prominent hasidic rebbes, to stem the progressive disintegration of the Jewish neighborhood. It presents their valiant attempts to provide the vital resources for its survival in the face of persistent poverty and other grave problems and to develop programs that would secure the future of this unique hasidic community. Kranzler concludes with the assertion that at the beginning of the '90s its inhabitants are hopeful of being able to weather the present crisis and to continue to function as one of pluralist America's viable religious communities.},

An assumption we make is that the phonetic systems used in the production and perception of vowels and consonants remain adap- tive over the life span, and that phonetic systems reorganize in response to sounds encountered in an L2 through the addition of new phonetic categories, or through the modification of old ones. The chapter is organized in the following way. Several general hypotheses concern- ing the cause of foreign accent in L2 speech production are summa- rized in the introductory section. In the next section, a model of L2 speech learning that aims to account for age-related changes in L2 pro- nunciation is presented. The next three sections present summaries of empirical research dealing with the production and perception of L2 vowels, word-initial consonants, and word-final consonants. The final section discusses questions of general theoretical interest, with special attention to a featural (as opposed to a segmental) level of analysis. Although nonsegmental (Le., prosodic) dimensions are an important source of foreign accent, the present chapter focuses on phoneme-sized units of speech. Although many different languages are learned as an$\backslash$nL2, the focus is on the acquisition of English.},

[from a review] 
James E. Flege reviews the principal findings and problems in L2 speech learning, and presents his Speech Learning Model. This model sets out to account for age-related limits on the ability to produce L2 vowels and consonants in a native-like fashion. Flege assumes that ‘the phonetic systems used in the production and perception of vowels and consonants remain adaptive over the life span, and that phonetic systems reorganize in response to sounds encountered in an L2 through the addition of new phonetic categories, or through the modification of old ones' (p. 233). A consequence of Flege's model is that foreign accents are caused, at least in part, by the inaccurate perception of sounds in an L2. The phonology of the native language filters out features of L2 sounds that are important phonetically but not phonologically. This fact would cause a true ‘perceptual foreign accent' that hinders phonetic production of the second language.

Results of two production experiments show that speaker age, language mode (monolingual Shanghainese vs. bilingual Shanghainese-Mandarin), and crosslinguistic phonological similarity all influence the production of these vowels.

In contrast, native English speaking listeners cannot distinguish our speaker's English productions by recent experience.

The book's unique blend of intellectual, religious, and social history offers perspectives on the movement's leaders as well as its followers, and demonstrates that, far from being a throwback to the Middle Ages, Hasidism is a product of modernity that forged its identity as a radical alternative to the secular world. Hasidism originated in southeastern Poland, in mystical circles centered on the figure of Israel Ba'al Shem Tov, but it was only after his death in 1760 that a movement began to spread. Challenging the notion that Hasidism ceased to be a creative movement after the eighteenth century, this book argues that its first golden age was in the nineteenth century, when it conquered new territory, won a mass following, and became a mainstay of Jewish Orthodoxy. World War I, the Russian Revolution, and the Holocaust decimated eastern European Hasidism. But following World War II, the movement enjoyed a second golden age, growing exponentially. Today, it is witnessing a remarkable renaissance in Israel, the United States, and other countries around the world. Written by an international team of scholars, Hasidism is a must-read for anyone seeking to understand this vibrant and influential modern Jewish movement.},

An analysis of the nonnative speakers' acquisition of these norms shows that [In] is more frequent before anterior segments (reflecting ease of articulation), and that males use [In] more frequently than females, especially in monitored speech (perhaps reflecting their desire to accommodate to a male native speaker norm rather than to an overall native speaker norm). The analysis also shows evidence of grammatical constraints which are different from those in the native speakers' speech. This difference may reflect the fact that it is easier to acquire the [In] variant in “frozen forms,” such as prepositions, than in productive rules.},

Using the 5{\%} Integrated Public Use Microdata Sample 1990 file, we examine the home languages of second- and third-generation children and compare the degree of their language shift against that among the descendants of European immigrants, as evidenced in the 1940 and 1970 censuses. Overall, the rates of speaking only English for a number of contemporary groups suggest that Anglicization is occurring at roughly the same pace for Asians as it did for Europeans, but is slower among the descendants of Spanish speakers. Multivariate models for three critical groups-Chinese, Cubans, and Mexicans-indicate that the home languages of third-generation children are most affected by factors, such as intermarriage, that determine the languages spoken by adults and by the communal context.},

@article{Fasold2007,
abstract = {Introduction Sociolinguists and generativists seem to have incompatible views of the psycholinguistic or cognitive status of variation. The sociolinguistic notion of inherent variability points to a single mental construct (i.e. a grammar) in which alternative realizations are possible. Generativists suggest that variation results only from the choice of different structures, an understanding that would imply different grammars, leaving only grammar switching as an alternative to inherent variability. Only some very recent contributions (e.g. Cornips and Corrigan 2005) attempt to deal with these apparently opposing views, and, in fact, historical attention to the problem has been minimal (but see Butters [1990], Fasold [1991], Preston [1991a, b, 1996a, b, 2000b, 2001b, 2002, 2004], andWolfram [1991] for earlier attempts to deal with the psycholinguistic validity of the notion variable rule). To approach this problem, we propose at least three kinds of variationist sociolinguistics, although we might more properly speak here of levels rather than kinds. Level I Some few variationist studies have concerned themselves only with the correlation of linguistic and social facts, and the outcomes from such Level I studies do not seem to lead to ready psycholinguistic interpretations. This does not mean that such studies have no theoretical interest; such interest, however, seems to lie principally in the area of social theory or in the interaction of social forces and linguistic forms (see note 2). For example, in a study of doctor–nt interaction (Marsh 1981), the occurrence of definite article versus pronominal in such sentences as How's the pain in the/your hand? is investigated. Table 3.1 shows how this choice is distributed for patients and physicians, patient social status, and long-term versus short-term physician–patient relationships.},

abstract = {This book traces the origins of modern varieties of Yiddish and presents evidence for the claim that, contrary to most accounts, Yiddish only developed into a separate language in the 15th century. Through a careful analysis of Yiddish phonology, morphology, orthography, and the Yiddish lexicon in all its varieties, Alexander Beider shows how what are commonly referred to as Eastern Yiddish and Western Yiddish have different ancestors. Specifically, he argues that the western branch is based on German dialects spoken in western Germany with some Old French influence, while the eastern branch has its origins in German dialects spoken in the modern-day Czech Republic with some Old Czech influence. The similarities between the two branches today are mainly a result of the close links between the underlying German dialects, and of the close contact between speakers. Following an introduction to the definition and classification of Yiddish and its dialects, chapters in the book investigate the German, Hebrew, Romance, and Slavic components of Yiddish, as well as the sound changes that have occurred in the various dialects. The book will be of interest to all those working in the areas of Yiddish and Jewish Studies in particular, and historical linguistics and history more generally.},

But is Bobover Yiddish similarly rooted in western Galician Yiddish? Interviews with informants from the Bobover community reveal a mixed picture. All showed phonological features of non-Hungarian Central Yiddish, but all featured “Hungarian” vocabulary. While most of the informants' grandparents were from interwar Poland, several had grandparents from the Unterland region; one-third identified their spouses as “Hungarian” or were members of “Hungarian” Hasidic communities. This shows the permeability of the two groups, leading to a mixing of features, which creates the need for shibboleths as clear markers of identity.},

But the majority of variationist research still focuses on English and other European languages, rather than lesser-studied language communities. Like other subfields of linguistics, the variationist paradigm needs to continually explore new data from a range of languages. The present article examines how the principles and methods of Labov () have been applied to non-English language communities, testing the impact and relevance of those half-century-old notions in new and sociolinguistically diverse settings, and calling for more research in new field sites.},

“As with any scientific program, new data sets provide new perspectives on earlier hypotheses. In some cases investigated here, results were consistent with the principles and methods developed in Labov (1966) and subsequent work. In other cases, the results suggested that a Western-based principle may be a special case of a more general principle. Other situations required a reinterpretation in the local sociocultural context. In all cases, the methods and ideas of Labov (1966) continue to be a solid foundation to build upon and gain more understanding of language variation.” 
“Eckert's (2012) third wave encourages sociolinguists to seek deeper understandings of the social meaning of variables, building on the prior waves of research. But that research agenda lacks a clear outward call to go beyond major world languages and beyond the familiar industrialized communities that we have always studied. What if a large number of variationist sociolinguists shifted this search for social meaning outward, proactively engaging with starkly different societies and new insights about social meaning, social structure, and variation that perhaps only they can provide?”

abstract = {Hasidism, a movement many believed had passed its golden age, has had an extraordinary revival since it was nearly decimated in the Holocaust and repressed in the Soviet Union. Hasidic communities, now settled primarily in North America and Israel, have reversed the losses they suffered and are growing exponentially. With powerful attachments to the past, mysticism, community, tradition, and charismatic leadership, Hasidism seems the opposite of contemporary Western culture, yet it has thrived in the democratic countries and culture of the West. How? Who Will Lead Us? finds the answers to this question in the fascinating story of five contemporary Hasidic dynasties and their handling of the delicate issue of leadership and succession. Revolving around the central figure of the rebbe, the book explores two dynasties with too few successors, two with too many successors, and one that believes their last rebbe continues to lead them even after his death. Samuel C. Heilman, recognized as a foremost expert on modern Jewish Orthodoxy, here provides outsiders with the essential guide to continuity in the Hasidic world.},
